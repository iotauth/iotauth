# Overview
---
This is a repository for an open-source project of **SST (Secure Swarm Toolkit)** and the local authentication and authorization entity, **Auth**, for the security of distributed systems and Internet of Things (IoT). Auth is a local point of authorization, and Auth's main roles are 1) providing authentication/authorization for its locally registered entities or devices and 2) working as a bridge of authorization between its local entities and the Internet. 

Our conference papers [[IoTDI '17](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3054980)], [[FiCloud '16](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7575852/)] describe a secure network architecture with key distribution mechanisms using Auth (local, automated authorization entity).
The architecture provides security guarantees while addressing IoT-related issues, including resource constraints and intermittent connectivity.
The architectural concept of locally centralized, globally distributed authentication and authorization is illustrated in our magazine article [[IT Professional '17'](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8057722/)].
Our ACM journal article [[ACM TIOT '20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3375837)] presents a secure migration technique as a recovery mechanism from Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks or failures.
In 2023, we released C API for SST introduced in an open-source software journal [[SoftwareX '23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711023000869)].
We also recently applied SST for securing the large-scale key-value storage [[SIGMOD '25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3725354)] and for access control of decentralized and distributed file systems [[Mid4CC '23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3631309.3632832)].

More publications on SST or using SST include [[SmartSP '24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13441)], [[FDL '23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272133)], and [[SenSys '23 - Poster Abstract]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3625687.3628408).

For the most in-depth technical document of SST, please refer to this Ph.D. dissertation [[UC Berkeley '17](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2017/EECS-2017-139.html)].

This repository includes 1) an open-source Java implementation of Auth and 2) sample codes for local entities to use Auth (authentication/authorization) services provided by Auth in various programming languages for different platforms.



# Prerequisites
---

1. OpenSSL command line tools for creating certificates and keystores of Auths and example entities
2. Java 11 or above
3. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for managing Java project of Auth
4. [Maven CLI (command line interface)](http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.1.0/maven-embedder/cli.html) for building Auth from the command line
5. Node.js for running example server and client entities

# Directory structure
---
- **android**: Directory for SST's Auth and entities for the Android platform (*currently under development*)
- **auth**: Directory for the Java implementation of Auth (local authentication/authorization entity), IntelliJ IDEA project
- **entity**: Directory for SST's APIs in C, Python, and JavaScript and example IoT entities using SST to be authenticated/authorized by Auth. This directory also includes [a sub-directory](https://github.com/iotauth/iotauth/tree/master/entity/node/accessors) for *Secure Communication Accessors* as software building blocks for writing IoT applications.
- **examples**: Directory for scripts and descriptions to run example Auths and entities.

# Quick start for SST
---
Please check [QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/iotauth/iotauth/blob/master/QUICKSTART.md) for a quick start of SST.

# Detailed examples with Auths and entities
---
See "How to run examples" in [README.md under *examples/*](https://github.com/iotauth/iotauth/blob/master/examples/README.md) for a fully working example.
